# MBMP shortcut configuration file
# Use to map a key press to commands
# 
# Format is the command followed by an equal sign then the key(s) to map. 
# Optionally whitespace then a hash (#) sign indicating the remainder of 
# the line is a comment.  More than one key may be mapped to a command, 
# in that case separate the keys by a space.
#
# Commands in the first column must be typed exactly as shown here.
# Keys and Description fields may be modified by the user. 
#
# Keys are not case sensitive.  The following strings are recognized:  
# "Ctrl", "Alt" and "Meta. Each must be followed by a plus sign
# and then the key (example: Ctrl+S).  
#
# The following non-character keys are parsed. Entries in the Text
# column are what should be used to describe the key. 
#   Key             Text 
#   Escape key      esc
#   Space key       space
#   Insert key      ins
#   Delete key      del
#   Up arrow key    up
#   Down arrow key  down
#   Function key    f1 to f12
#
#
# Reserved Keys:
# A hash (#) indicates a comment. All text on a line after the first # is
# treated as a comment and is not parsed.     
#
# In the case of multiple shortcuts keys only
# the first one will be displayed in the menus, although each shortcut
# will be active.
